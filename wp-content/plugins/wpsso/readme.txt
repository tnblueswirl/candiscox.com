<h4>Why Choose WPSSO?</h4>

<p><strong>Comprehensive Optimization</strong></p>

<p><strong>WPSSO uses your <em>existing</em> content to generate meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values, but if you want to, you can customize just about anything and everything. ;-)</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> social meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; including titles, descriptions, hashtags, images, videos, ecommerce product details, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, ratings, event details, recipe information, and much more &mdash; all from your <em>existing</em> content.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO provides all the information social websites and search engines need</strong> &mdash; improving social engagement, Google Search ranking, and click-through-rates on Facebook, Google Search / Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO includes special support and optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; providing customized Pinterest image sizes, and avoiding conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook Open Graph meta tags.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO offers a <em>fast</em> and <em>reliable</em> framework for developers and advanced users</strong> &mdash; offering dozens of 3rd party integration modules in the Pro version, several Free and Pro extensions, and hundreds of filter hooks to easily customize WPSSO's behavior and output.</p>

<blockquote class="top_info">
<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>
