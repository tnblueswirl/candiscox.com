<p><img src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png" style="width:33%;min-width:128px;max-width:256px;height:auto;float:left;margin:10px 60px 40px 0;" /><strong>WPSSO creates <em>complete</em> and <em>accurate</em> meta tags and Schema markup.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WPSSO uses your <em>existing</em> content to generate meta tags and Schema markup</strong> &mdash; there's no need to manually enter / configure any additional settings or values.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO provides all the information search engines and social websites need</strong> &mdash; improving <em>Google Search ranking</em>, <em>social engagement</em> and <em>click-through-rates</em> on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and many more.</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO also includes special support and optimization features for Pinterest</strong> &mdash; avoiding conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook Open Graph meta tags.</p>
